Scripting & Programming Applications (C++ Student Roster)

This project was completed as part of WGUâ€™s C867 Scripting & Programming Applications course. It demonstrates core programming concepts in C++, including object-oriented programming, arrays, pointers, control structures, functions, and enumerations.

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

The application simulates a student roster system for a university course. It parses student data, creates Student objects, and manages them using a Roster class. The program validates emails, calculates average days in courses, and allows filtering by degree program.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Student Class: Stores student ID, name, email, age, course completion days, and degree program.

Roster Class: Manages an array of Student*, supports add/remove, and includes print functions.

Email Validation: Detects missing @, . or spaces in email addresses.

Statistics: Prints each studentâ€™s average days to complete courses.

Filtering: Prints students by degree program (Security, Network, Software).

Dynamic Memory: Uses pointers and a destructor to free allocated memory.

ðŸ”¹ Skills Demonstrated

C++ syntax, variables, and data types

Control flow with loops and conditionals

Arrays and pointer-based data structures

Enumerations for program design

Object-Oriented Programming (classes, encapsulation, getters/setters)

Memory management with constructors and destructors
Notes

Student data is seeded with four sample students plus your own info (A5).
